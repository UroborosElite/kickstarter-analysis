# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Analysis of trends among Kickstarter campaigns
### Purpose
The goal of this analysis is to increase the probability of client Louise's campaign success by replicating components of successful campaigns while minimizing common qualities with failed or canceled campaigns.

Louise estimates her own play will cost approximately $12,000 US dollars. This analysis places emphasis on examining campaigns with similar elements such as campaigns for plays with similar monetary goals. Factors contributing to campaign success, failure, cancellation are highlighted using visualizations such as line charts.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Successful campaigns peak in the Month of May. Successful campaigns more than doubled the failed kickstarters this month. This trend continues into June. May and June are the most popular months to launch kickstarters so competition for funds will be high.

The most challenging month for kickstarters was December, as the number of successful and failed kickstarters was almost equal. It is not surprising that this is also the least popular month for launching kickstarters as only 75 campaigns were launched in the categories analyzed.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
At 76%, the most successful campaign outcomes occurred when campaign goals were under $1000. Campaigns with a goal between $10000 and $14999 were only successful 54% of the time. Seeing as Louise's play has an estimated cost of $12000, her success odds fall within this 54% goal range. Louise would need to reduce her campaign goal to cover less of her play, up to and including $4999 in order to raise her success odds to over 70%.

The total number of projects was highest at 534, with goals between $1000 to $4999, while maintaining a success rate of 73%. Although this indicates that this goal range is likely to yield success for Louise, it also means that she will see increased competition for financial backers looking at similar campaigns with similar goals. Louise will need to do something to make her campaign stand out from the group. This may be addressed in her choice of incentives for pledges, for example.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
One major challenge was learning to use most of the functions an processes covered in Module 1 within MS Excel. A lot of these processes I have never used before. The last time I used MS Excel was over ten years ago so even some basic commands slowed my progress down significantly.

Another challenge was trying to fully grasp the 'why' behind some calculations involved in this analysis. I have not needed to utilize anything above basic arithmetic in many years. I have never been one to memorize formulas, preferring to try and make sense of it before moving forward. It is not practical, timewise, but it allows me to apply critical thinking to their use. The slower workflow involved with learning a new skill is something I find very frustrating. 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

In order to increase her success odds, Louise should launch her campaign in May or June, preferably May. Although competition for backers will be stiff as these months are also the most popular for launching kickstarters, the probability of success makes this the optimal launch date.

After May, Kickstarter success in the theater category trends downward at a consistent rate, until September. This would further narrow down Louise's launch timeframe to May and early June, in order to launch her campaign when the chances of success are at their highest.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

I can conclude that more successful campaigns have lower goals set. This means that it would be in Louise's best interest to keep her goal under $4999.

Louise will need to rely on tiered incentives for pledges and a compelling blurb or personal video advocating for her campaign. This will help her play stand out from the crowded $1000 to $4999 goal range campaigns.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

This dataset does not take note of any promotion the individuals organizing these campaigns did. It does not account for social media shares and mentions of the campaign. It does not account for organizers with multiple campaigns who may have financial backers who contribute to the same individual's projects. This dataset also does not account for what percentage of the complete production costs were actually covered by the kickstarter campaigns. It does not answer the question, if a kickstarter is only supplementing play production costs and not covering costs completely then what percentage of the proposed production costs were covered by kickstarter and what portion was supplemented through other means?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Possible visual aids to address these limitations could include a graph detailing the methods used to promote these campaigns, such as social media hashtag mentions, frequency of social media shares of Kickstarter campaigns within the corresponding timeframes, that align with the categories analyzed.
